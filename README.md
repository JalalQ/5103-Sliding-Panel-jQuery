# Introduction

Working sliding panels for the content boxes usin jQuery.
1. The paragraphs start hidden.
2. The paragraphs show and hide when their headings are clicked.
3. This process should take 3 seconds.
4. Mousing over the paragraph will reverse the colours of the text and background. Mousing out will switch the colours back to their original values.

Create a more user-friendly table with jQuery.
1. When the page first loads, the user does not see any text under the Description heading.
2. If the user puts the cursor over a row, that row alone becomes red.
3. If the user clicks on a row, the description for that item appears.
4. Only one description is visible at a time.
